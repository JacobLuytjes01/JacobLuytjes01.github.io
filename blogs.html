        <h3>StringNum</h3>
        <div>
            I had an idea for a number system because integers have a small range and do not have any decimal components. Then, floating point can have rounding errors and cannot represent every possible number. I wanted to use a system that could have near-infinite precision; however, I was unaware of the existence of BigNum systems. So, I started to build.<br>
            I wrote the project in C++ to be fast and easily usable in C++ and Python code bases. The numbers are represented internally using strings, as I was more familiar with them than char arrays, and I wanted to be able to add Binary, hexadecimal, or other formats, and not only decimal.<br>
            I used test-driven development to help create features and correctly implement the basic math functions. Due to the length of this project, it was useful in debugging a large code base and in determining where and what to fix whenever I encountered a bug.<br>
            I have currently implemented addition, subtraction, multiplication, prefix and postfix operators, all relational operators, and some helper functions.<br>
            The possible features I could add would be division, and compound assignment operators.<br>
            This project was a useful learning experience in building a large-scale system.

        <h3>Balatro Mod</h3>
        <div>
            Since I played a lot of Balatro, I wanted to make a mod for the game. It was an interesting learning experience in trying to figure out how to create certain card effects, as the documentation was difficult to find and scattered over Discord when I was making my mod.<br>
            It was interesting to try programming in Lua, but it was mostly me taking code from other places and slapping it into my mod with tweaks to make it work. I had an interesting experience with one mod that was corrupting some of the features I was using, so I had to debug and figure out which mod was causing my code to fail and update it. The mod was Cryptid, and the issue was fixed in version V0.5.14a.<br>
            It was also fun making the art for my mod, as I learned a small amount of image editing to make some cards.<br>
            This project was a very practical experience, and made me more interested in creating high-quality documentation for my future projects because I was having major difficulties with SteamModded.

        <h3>Student Grade Calculator</h3>
        <div>
            I started this project to learn about React over the summer. Then, after learning more about React in school, I revisited this project to implement better design patterns and polish up my React knowledge.<br>
            The things I improved after gaining knowledge were creating a higher-quality mobile view, modernizing the component format, and utilizing higher-level JavaScript functions, like map and spread operators. I changed the UI and removed unneeded complexity and functions.<br>
            This project helped me learn React and retain the knowledge I had learned in school.

        <h3>Fractional Approximation of PI Calculator</h3>
        <div>
            I was looking for something to program as I wanted more projects for my resume and portfolio. Then, after a drought of ideas, I thought about how certain fractions approximate PI, like 22/7 or 335/113, and how it would be interesting to create a program to find the best fractions.<br>
            The first major problem I had was that 44/14 would appear when 22/7 was there. I tried a couple of ways to get 44/14 to disappear. First, I type-cast the values into integers and check if the numerator and denominator modulo of the surrounding ranking's numerator and denominator equals zero [check if they are exact matches]. However, this did not work because I wanted the user to be able to use fractional components for both numerator and denominator. Then, I checked if two numbers are extremely close together; they would not show up, but this caused issues when I increased the numbers it checked. It would skip over numbers.<br>
            Finally, I made a solution that worked well enough. I took the previous solution, but made the lower bounds get divided by the maximum denominator that would be checked. This solved the problem in a simple way by showing the correct ranking for any depth while removing duplicates.

        <h3>Easy Image Signature</h3>
        <div>
            When I was working on my 3D modeling projects, I often did not put my name on my work because it would take too much time. Then, to improve my work, I programmed a useful project to sign my images. I used FFmpeg and Node.js to make it.<br>
            The project helped save me time, and I sign my work more often, so it is a success.
